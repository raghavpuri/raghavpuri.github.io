        <b>Hi, I'm Raghav!</b> I'm a junior at <a href = "https://engineering.brown.edu/">Brown</a> studying Computer Science.
        This website is a growing project to hopefully capture a little about who I am and what I love doing. Among other things, I love technology, history and design and using some combination of these to create things that make an impact.<br/> 
        <br/><b>Most Recently,</b> I<br>   
        <ul>
            <li>worked at <a href = "https://www.standardmetrics.io">Standard Metrics</a> as an intern on the Product team, building a portfolio collaboration tool for investors and their portfolio companies.</li>   
            <li>did a Fellowship at <a href = "https://www.8vc.com/fellowship">8VC</a> and met some cool people.</li>    
            <li>software for a drone system to map biodiversity in rainforests for the Rainforest XPrize (we got eliminated in the quarter finals :( )</li>      
            <li>suffered the consequences of taking too many STEM classes at Brown.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <b>A little less recently,</b> I<br>
        <ul> 
            <li>set up a supply-chain for manufacturing low cost wearables for Alzheimers patients in New Delhi.</li>      
            <li>built ArchGAN to learn from datasets of hieroglyphics and attempt to inpaint unseen 2D Images to aid archaeological efforts.</li> 
            <li>interned at a startup based in New Delhi to develop a decentralised system for emergency medical record retrieval in case of accidents to pitch to the Government of India.</li>     
        </ul>
        <br>           
        All of this may sound impressive by traditional measures. Know, though, that this is - while being true - also a very incomplete picture of me. 
        This whole site is composed with the intent of marketing myself. All my countless mistakes, failures and bad decisions are conveniently sweeped under 
        the rug. But rest assured that there are many, many mistakes I commited, bad turns I took and poor decisions I made. So take all of this with a grain(or two) of salt.
