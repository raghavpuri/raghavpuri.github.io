        <p>
        <b>Hi, I'm Raghav!</b> I am an incoming freshman at <a href = "https://engineering.brown.edu/">Brown</a>. I love robots, computers and design and I love creating things that make an impact. Currently, I'm part of a team at <a href = "https://www.wur.nl/en/wageningen-university.htm">Waginengen University</a> using drone tech to survey rainforests and help facilitate a better understanding of that environment (see <a href = "">WURitos</a>).</br><br/>
        <b>Some cool stuff I did in school.</b> I was a finalist at the <a href = "https://www.societyforscience.org/blog/the-2019-intel-isef-top-award-winners/">International Science and Engineering Fair</a> in 2019 for making a GAN based system to inpaint(complete) incomplete hieroglyphic scripts found in archaeological excavations. Here's a <a href = "">blog</a> I wrote about it. In 2018, I also won an award by the <a href = "https://www.nasa.gov/goddard">
        NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre</a> for designing a proposal for a Maglev based airstrip apparatus to help airplanes land in harsh weather conditions. I <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atU80MgdFqU">pitched</a> this system with my team at the <a href = "https://www.conradchallenge.org/">Conrad Spirit of Innovation Challenge</a>. I also did a some other interesting projects like Plot(a CV-sensor based virtual assitant for Alzheimers patients) 
        and versaTILE(a low cost particle detector that eliminates charge ambiguity in readings).<br/><br/><b>Some other stuff.</b> In the fall of 2018, I also interned at Hybrid Idea, a startup based in New Delhi to develop a decentralised system for emergency medical record retrieval in case of accidents to pitch to the <a href = "https://niti.gov.in/">NITI Aayog</a>, a branch of the Government of India. I'm also a developer at <a href = "https://hackatbrown.org/">
        Hack@Brown</a>, Brown's largest annual hackathon. For some of my projects listed above, I was also awarded the <a href = "">National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement</a> in 2020 by the President and Prime Minister of India in the category of Innovation.The Prime Minister even <a href = "">tweeted</a> about me!<br/><br/> <b>If you'd like to get in touch with me</b> to collaborate on something or know more about my projects or even If you'd just like to 
        talk, you can reach me at raghav[underscore]puri[at]brown[dot]edu
